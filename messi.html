	       You’ve won a lot of awards but this is your first The Best. How do you feel?
	   </h1> 
	   <p class="ro">
	       I’m very happy to receive this award. Like I always say, though, individual awards are secondary to me because it’s the team that counts. It’s a special night because I’m lucky enough to have my wife here and two of my three children as well. To be able to enjoy this moment with them is unique.

	      This award aside, how would you sum up the season you’ve just had?
	   </h1> 
	   <p class="ro">
	     It was strange. We were having a fantastic season as a team and then one match changed it all (Barcelona’s defeat to Liverpool in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final). It was such a massive disappointment that we just didn’t attach any importance to the League and we didn’t prepare properly for the Copa del Rey final. That’s how big a blow it was for us. That one game left its mark on a season that had been perfect up to then. We were so close to making another Champions League final, but it ended up being a painful campaign for us.
